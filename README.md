# week-5-JQuery-Schedule

This Project is a work day scheduler.  From the times of 8am till 5pm there are areas in which you can save and alter text as if it were tasks throughout the day.  These columns also change color based on the time of the day.  My motivation for this project was to create a scheduler that would dynamically update based on real world events as well as save user input for later use.  I built this project in order to have a better understanding of local storage as well as accessing and implementing third party APIs.  This project solves the issue of having to remember all of your tasks throughout the day.  This project proved to be a little challenging due to the implementation of a third party API as well as having to use their documentation in order to get it to function correctly.
